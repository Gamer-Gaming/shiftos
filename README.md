## License

We are licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/shiftos-game/ShiftOS/blob/master/LICENSE). A simple description is:

1. Don't steal our code and claim ownership of it
2. Leave copyright statements and license info at the top of all .cs files. `InsertLicense.exe` can be used to add the license to all files without it.


### Using our code for your own project

You may use the ShiftOS.Engine, ShiftOS.Objects, and ShiftOS.Server projects to create your own games. You must include the original license and link back to [ShiftOS](https://github.com/shiftos-game/ShiftOS) in your `README` and in your game or credits.

## Compiling the code

To compile the code, simply clone the repository, and open it in Visual Studio. Then, set `ShiftOS.WinForms` as your startup project by right-clicing it in **Solution Explorer**. Then, hit **F5** to compile and run the game.

## Where the hell is the **Issues** tab? This can't be GitHub!

No, you're wrong. We've actually disabled the Issues tab in place of our own in-place [bugtracker](http://getshiftos.ml/Bugs). Please post bugs there. It is easier for us to track and integrate with the rest of the community.
